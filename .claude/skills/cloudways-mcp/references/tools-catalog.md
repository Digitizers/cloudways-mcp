# Tools Catalog — Cloudways MCP

The official tool catalog for the **Cloudways (Remote) MCP** (`https://mcp.cloudways.com/mcp/`), taken from the official support articles: [Cloudways MCP Server Tools](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/15798823-cloudways-mcp-server-tools) (the dedicated tool reference) and [How to Use Cloudways MCP Server](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/14654372-how-to-use-cloudways-mcp-server-for-ai-based-server-management) (setup). Tools appear in Claude as `mcp__cloudways__<tool>` (or `mcp__cloudways-<client>__<tool>` per account).

**MCP v1.2 scale:** ~244 tools total (per the [v1.2 announcement](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/cloudways-mcp-v1-2-112-new-tools-role-based-access-tokens-and-full-cloudways-api-coverage/) — 112 added in v1.2, covering essentially the full Cloudways API). Your client initially sees only **65 tools** (62 high-frequency direct tools + the 3 meta-tools below); everything else is discovered and invoked on demand through the meta-tools.

Flags: **R** = read-only · **W** = write (requires confirmation) · **W!** = destructive / irreversible (requires double confirmation).

> The **live server is the source of truth.** Sections up to and including "Toolset meta-tools" were reconciled against the live MCP (v1.1 era, via `list_available_toolsets` + `get_toolset_tools`); the "New in MCP v1.2" sections below are taken from the official tools article and **not yet re-enumerated against the live server** — verify names via `get_toolset_tools` before relying on them in automation. You do **not** need to memorize tool names to use the MCP (it resolves natural language), but knowing them sharpens prompts and lets you confirm an action maps to the tool you expect.
>
> **Most tools are grouped into on-demand toolsets.** Only a subset appears in your default tool list; the rest live inside toolsets (`apps`, `servers`, `git`, `ssh_keys`, `projects`, `staging_management`, `dns_made_easy`, `cloudflare`, and the v1.2 additions) and are invoked through the `execute_tool` proxy. A tool being absent from the default list does **not** mean it is absent from the MCP — `git_*`, `project_*`, `ssh_key_*`, `app_restore_rollback`, `app_db_password_update`, `server_local_backup_delete`, and `staging_app_clone*` are all live via their toolsets (live-verified in v1.1).
>
> There is no `ping` / `customer_info` / `rate_limit_status` tool — verify connectivity with `server_list` and identify the account by the connection prefix.

> **Last verified:** 2026-07-19 against the official support articles (v1.2). Categories under "New in MCP v1.2" pending live-MCP re-enumeration. **Note:** three categories are split across the two halves of this file — Cloudflare CDN, Add-on Management, and Copilot each have a pre-v1.2 table above and an "expanded in v1.2" table below; check both.

## Server Management

| Tool | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `server_list` | R | List all servers (status, provider, region, IP, app count). |
| `server_get` | R | Detailed info on one server (hosted apps + configuration). |
| `server_create` | W | Create a server on DigitalOcean/AWS/GCE/Vultr/Linode with an initial app. |

# New in MCP v1.2 (2026-07)

Everything below was added in Cloudways MCP v1.2 and is documented in the [official tools article](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/15798823-cloudways-mcp-server-tools). These categories **close the gaps this catalog previously flagged as "UI/direct-API only"**: SSL / Let's Encrypt, SSH/MySQL/Adminer/Web-SSH IP whitelisting, and team-member management are now MCP tools. Most of these live in on-demand toolsets (invoked via `execute_tool`); R/W/W! risk tags below are this skill's operational assessment, not Cloudways labels.

## Security — SSL & IP Access (new in v1.2)

| Tool | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `security_lets_encrypt_install` | W | Provision + install a Let's Encrypt SSL cert on an app (HTTP-01 or DNS-01 challenge). |
| `security_lets_encrypt_renew` | W | Force an out-of-cycle renewal of an existing Let's Encrypt cert. |

| `security_get_whitelisted_ips_mysql` | R | List IPs whitelisted for remote MySQL access. |
| `security_update_whitelisted_ips` | W! | **Replace** the SSH/SFTP or MySQL IP whitelist — overrides the current list; a wrong list can lock you (or the client) out. Always read the current list first. |
| `security_check_blacklisted_ip` | R | Check whether an IP is blacklisted on the server. |
| `security_whitelist_ip_siab` | W | Whitelist an IP for Shell-in-a-Box (browser Web SSH). |
| `security_whitelist_ip_adminer` | W | Whitelist an IP for Adminer (browser DB manager). |

> The tools article also lists API-endpoint-style aliases for some of these (`security_dns_create`, `security_dns_verify`, `security_lets_encrypt_auto_renewal_update`, `security_mysql_whitelisted_ips_get`, `security_ssh_sftp_whitelisted_ips_get`, `security_whitelisted_ips_update`, `security_ip_blacklist_check`, `security_adminer_allow`, `security_siab_allow`).

## Cloudflare CDN — expanded in v1.2

The three tools above (`cloudflare_add_domain`, `cloudflare_get_details`, `cloudflare_get_txt_records`) existed before; v1.2 adds:

| Tool | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `cloudflare_delete_domain` | W! | Offboard a domain from Cloudflare CDN — proxying stops; can break production behavior. |
| `cloudflare_transfer_domain` | W | Move a domain's CDN attachment between apps in the same account. |
| `cloudflare_purge_domain` | W | Purge the Cloudflare edge cache for a domain. |
| `cloudflare_get_dns_query` | R | Cloudflare DNS verification status for a domain. |
| `cloudflare_verify_txt_records` | W | Trigger an immediate re-check of the published TXT records. |
| `cloudflare_get_fpc_status` | R | Smart Cache Purge (FPC) deployment status. |
| `cloudflare_deploy_fpc` | W | Configure/deploy Smart Cache Purge for a domain. |
| `cloudflare_get_settings` | R | Per-domain Cloudflare settings (caching, minify, image optimization, …). |
| `cloudflare_get_analytics` | R | Cache analytics (hit rate, bandwidth saved, edge requests). |
| `cloudflare_get_security_analytics` | R | Security analytics (threats blocked, WAF events, bot mitigation). |
| `cloudflare_get_logpush_analytics` | R | Raw Logpush request-log analytics. |
| `cloudflare_get_logpush_security` | R | Raw Logpush security-event data. |

## CloudwaysCDN (legacy) (new in v1.2)

Legacy CDN product — distinct from the Cloudflare integration above.

| Tool | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `cloudwayscdn_details_get` | R | CloudwaysCDN details for an app. |
| `cloudwayscdn_bandwidth_get` | R | CDN bandwidth usage. |
| `cloudwayscdn_setup` | W | Set up CloudwaysCDN for an app. |
| `cloudwayscdn_activate` | W | Activate CloudwaysCDN. |
| `cloudwayscdn_purge_assets` | W | Purge CDN assets. |
| `cloudwayscdn_website_url_update` | W | Update the site URL used by the CDN. |
| `cloudwayscdn_subscription_remove` | W! | Remove the CloudwaysCDN subscription. |

## Add-on Management — expanded in v1.2

In addition to the five `addon_*` tools above:

| Tool | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `addon_upgrade` | W | Upgrade an activated add-on to a higher-tier package — changes cost. |
| `addon_request` | W | Submit a per-app add-on request (for add-ons provisioned per application). |
| `addon_elastic_list_domains` | R | List Elastic Email sender domains. |
| `addon_elastic_verify_domain` | W | Verify a sender domain's DNS in Elastic Email. |
| `addon_elastic_delete_domain` | W! | Delete a sender domain from Elastic Email — mail from that domain stops sending. |

## Lists API — reference data (new in v1.2)

All read-only; predefined values used across other calls.

| Tool | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `apps_list` | R | Supported application types. |
| `providers_list` | R | Supported cloud providers. |
| `regions_list` | R | Available provider regions. |
| `server_sizes_list` | R | Available server sizes. |
| `packages_list` | R | Available packages (PHP/MySQL versions, …). |
| `backup_frequencies_list` | R | Supported backup frequencies. |
| `countries_list` | R | Supported countries. |
| `monitor_durations_list` | R | Monitoring duration options. |
| `monitor_targets_list` | R | Monitoring target options. |
| `settings_list` | R | Supported settings options. |

## Authentication API (new in v1.2)

| Tool | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `oauth_access_token_generate` | W | Generate an OAuth access token for direct Cloudways API calls. Tagged W (not R) because it **mints a live credential** — never call it as part of a "just check things" flow, and **never print the token in responses.** |

> The tools article also lists Service API aliases (`service_state_update`, `service_varnish_manage`, `service_app_varnish_get`) alongside the named `service_start`/`service_stop`/`service_restart`/`varnish_manage`/`varnish_app_manage`/`varnish_app_status` tools above — same operations, endpoint-style naming. Prefer whichever the live MCP exposes.

---

## Still not exposed (use UI or direct API)

- **SSH-key listing** — keys are managed via `ssh_key_create`/`ssh_key_update`/`ssh_key_delete`, but there is no read/list tool; audit the stored-key roster in the Cloudways UI.
- **Backup listing** — `app_backup_status_get` reports only an in-progress backup; available restore points are visible in the UI.
- **Account/plan info** — no `customer_info` tool; plan/billing status of the Cloudways account itself is UI-only.
